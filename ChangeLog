AutoCorres 1.1 (9 Oct 2015)
--------------

	* Isabelle2015 edition of both AutoCorres and the C parser.

	* New options for changing how AutoCorres names functions and globals.

	* Incompatibility: names of global variables have changed.
	  Names have changed from “lifted_globals.foo_'” to
	  “lifted_globals.foo_''”. Recover the old behaviour by setting
	  lifted_globals_field_suffix="_'".

	* Minor incompatibility: intermediate function names have changed.
	  They are now “l1_foo'”, “l2_foo'”... instead of “l1_foo”, “l2_foo”.

	* Renamed “ccorres” predicate to “ac_corres” for clarity.


AutoCorres 1.0 (16 Dec 2014)
--------------

	* New option “no_opt” to turn off simplifier stages. (Experimental)

	* New options for tracing some of AutoCorres's internal translations.
