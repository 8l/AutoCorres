(*
 * Attribute tracing
 *
 * The idea of this file is to allow users to determine how the simpset,
 * cong set, intro set, wp sets, etc. have changed from an old version
 * of the repository to a new version.
 *
 * The process is as follows:
 *
 *   1. A user runs "save_attributes" on an old, working version of the
 *      theory.
 *
 *   2. This tool will write out a ".foo.attrib_trace" file for each
 *      theory processed.
 *
 *   3. The user modifies imports statements as required, possibly
 *      breaking the proof.
 *
 *   4. The user can now run "diff_attributes" to determine what
 *      commands they should run to restore the simpset / congset /etc
 *      to something closer to the old version.
 *
 * The tool is not complete, in that it won't always suggest the full
 * set of "simp add", "simp del", etc commands. Nor does it know that
 * a rule added to the simpset is causing a problem. It merely lists
 * a hopefully-sensible set of differences.
