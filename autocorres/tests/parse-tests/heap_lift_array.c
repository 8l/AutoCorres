/*
 * Heap lifting for arrays.
 * Regression: JIRA VER-423.
 *
 * Unlike {read,write}_to_global_array.c, this takes the address of foo,
 * forcing C-parser to place it in symbol_table and not the globals record.
 * This tests the ability of AutoCorres to translate to the correct
 * heap access constructs on the lifted heap.
