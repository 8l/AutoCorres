AutoCorres
==========

AutoCorres is a tool that assists reasoning about C programs
in [Isabelle/HOL][1]. In particular, it uses Norrish's
[C-to-Isabelle parser][2] to parse C into Isabelle, and then
abstracts the result to produce a result that is (hopefully)
more pleasant to reason about.

Installation
------------

AutoCorres is packaged as a theory for Isabelle2015:

    http://isabelle.in.tum.de

To build it, type

    isabelle build -d . AutoCorres

in the root of this release. This builds the C parser and AutoCorres itself.
There is also a test suite, which can be run using:

    isabelle build -d . AutoCorresTest



Quickstart
----------

See quickstart.pdf for a brief tutorial on AutoCorres.
The accompanying theory files can be found in autocorres/doc/quickstart.



Development and reporting bugs
------------------------------

AutoCorres is currently maintained by Japheth Lim <Japheth.Lim@nicta.com.au>.

Additionally, the latest development version is available on GitHub
as part of the L4.verified project:

    https://github.com/NICTA/l4v (in tools/autocorres)



Package contents
----------------

This package contains:

    * The AutoCorres tool, translating the output of the C parser (below)
      into higher-level logic.

    * Michael Norrish's C parser, used to translate C code into Isabelle:

        http://www.ertos.nicta.com.au/software/c-parser/

    * Norbert Schirmer's Simpl language and associated VCG tool. The
      C parser translates C into Schirmer's Simpl language:

        http://afp.sourceforge.net/entries/Simpl.shtml

    * Code from SML/NJ, including an implementation of binary sets
      (Binaryset.ML) and the mllex and mlyacc tools
      (tools/{mllex,mlyacc}). These are used by the C parser.

    * Code from the mlton compiler, in particular regions during lexing
      and parsing (Region.ML, SourceFile.ML and SourcePos.ML). These are
      used by the C parser.

    * NICTA compatibility word libraries and associated lemmas, for
      assisting with reasoning about words (such as 32-bit words).

    * Libraries from NICTA for defining and reasoning about monads,
      including definitions for nondeterministic state monads and option
      monads, along with a large proof library relating to these
      definitions.

    * The NICTA "wp" weakest precondition tool, which can be used to
      assists in proving Hoare triples on monadic programs.



Options
-------

AutoCorres supports a variety of options, which are used as follows:

    autocorres [option, key=val, list=a b c d] "file.c"

The options are:

  * `unsigned_word_abs = FUNC_NAMES`: Use _word abstraction_
    on unsigned integers in the given functions.

  * `no_signed_word_abs = FUNC_NAMES`: Disable signed
    _word abstraction_ on the given list of functions.

  * `skip_word_abs`: Completely disable _word abstraction_.

  * `ts_rules = RULES`: Enable _type strengthening_ to the
    following types. Possible types include `pure` (pure
    functional), `option` (option monad without state), `gets` (option
    monad with state) and `nondet` (non-deterministic state monad).

  * `ts_force RULE_NAME = FUNC_NAMES`: Force the given
    functions to be type-strengthened to the given type,
    even if a "better" type could otherwise be used.
    See `tests/examples/type_strengthen_tricks.thy`.

  * `no_heap_abs = FUNC_NAMES`: Disable _heap abstraction_
    on the given list of functions.

  * `force_heap_abs = FUNC_NAMES`: Attempt _heap abstraction_
    on the given list of functions, even if AutoCorres' heuristics
    believes that they cannot be lifted.

  * `heap_abs_syntax`: Enable experimental heap abstraction
    syntactic sugar.

  * `skip_word_abs`: Completely disable _heap abstraction_.

Name compatibility options (see `tests/examples/AC_Rename.thy`):

  * `lifted_globals_field_prefix="foo"`, `lifted_globals_field_suffix="foo"`:
    Override generated names for global variables during heap abstraction.
    The default is `f` -> `f_''` (i.e. prefix="", suffix="_''").

  * `function_name_prefix="foo"`, `function_name_suffix="foo"`:
    Override generated names for abstracted functions.
    The default is `f` -> `f'` (i.e. prefix="", suffix="'").

Less common options (mainly for debugging):

  * `keep_going`: Attempt to ignore certain non-critical
    errors.

  * `scope`: Only parse the given functions and their
    callees, up to depth `scope_depth`.

  * `trace_heap_lift = FUNC_NAMES`: Trace the _heap abstraction_
    process for each of the given functions. The traces
    are stored in the Isabelle theory and can be quite large.
    See `tests/examples/TraceDemo.thy`.

  * `trace_word_abs = FUNC_NAMES`: As above, but traces
    _word abstraction_.

  * `trace_opt`: As above, but traces internal simplification
    phases (for all functions).

  * `no_opt`: Disable some optimisation passes that simplify
    the AutoCorres output.

  * `gen_word_heaps`: Force _heap abstraction_ to create
    abstract heaps for standard `word` types
    (`word8`, `word16`, `word32`, `word64`) even if they
    are not needed.

An example of invoking AutoCorres with _all_ of the options
is as follows:

    autocorres [
        unsigned_word_abs = f g h,
        no_signed_word_abs = i j k,
        skip_word_abs,  (* mutually exclusive with previous rules *)
        ts_rules = pure nondet,
        ts_force nondet = l m n,
        no_heap_abs = a b,
        force_heap_abs = c d,
        gen_word_heaps,
        skip_heap_abs,  (* mutually exclusive with previous rules *)
        heap_abs_syntax,
        keep_going,
        scope = o p q,
        scope_depth = 5,
        trace_heap_lift = c d,
        trace_word_abs = f h i,
        no_opt,
        lifted_globals_name_prefix="my_global_",
        lifted_globals_name_suffix="",
        function_name_prefix="my_func_",
        function_name_suffix=""
        ] "filename.c"



Examples
--------

Some examples are in the `autocorres/tests/examples` directory.

Many of these examples are quick-and-dirty proofs, and should not
necessary be considered the best style.

None-the-less, some of the examples available are, in approximate
increasing level of difficulty:

  * `Simple.thy`: Proofs of some simple functions, including
    `max` and `gcd`.

  * `Swap.thy`: Proof of a simple `swap` function.

  * `MultByAdd.thy`: Proof of a function that carries out
    multiplication using addition.

  * `Factorial.thy`: Proof of a factorial function, using
    several different methods.

  * `FibProof.thy`: Proof of the Fibonacci function, using
    several different methods.

  * `ListRev.thy`: Proof of a function that carries out an
    in-place linked list reversal.

  * `CList.thy`: Another list reversal, based on a proof by
    Mehta and Nipkow. See [the paper][3].

  * `IsPrime.thy`: Proof of a function that determines if
    the input number is prime.

  * `Memset.thy`: Proof of a C `memset` implementation.

  * `Quicksort.thy`: Proof of a simple quicksort
    implementation on an array of `int`s.

  * `BinarySearch.thy`: Proof of a function that determines
    if a sorted input array of `unsigned int` contains the
    given `unsigned int`.

  * `SchorrWaite.thy`: Proof a C implementation of the
    Schorr-Waite algorithm, using Mehta and Nipkow's
    high-level proof. See [the paper][3].

  * `Memcpy.thy`: Proof of a C `memcpy` implementation.
    The proof connects the C parser's byte-level heap
    with AutoCorres's type-safe heap representation.

There are also some examples that aren't about program proofs,
but demonstrate AutoCorres features:

  * `AC_Rename.thy`: how to change AutoCorres-generated names.

  * `TraceDemo.thy`: how to use the (experimental) tracing.

  * `type_strengthen_tricks.thy`: configuring type-strengthening.
