# Installation Instructions for the C-Parser

This code requires Isabelle2014.

To build the main heap CParser, use the following command in this directory (src/c-parser).

    isabelle build -d . -b CParser

Add a -v option if you want to see reassuring progress messages.

You can also build a regression test with the command

    isabelle build -d . -d testfiles -b CParserTest

## Other Tools

There are two executables that can be built in the standalone-parser directory.
These require the mlton SML compiler and can be built with calls to make in that directory:

    make standalone-cparser
    make standalone-tokenizer

## Using the C Parser

Theories wishing to use the parser must have CTranslation as an ancestor.
